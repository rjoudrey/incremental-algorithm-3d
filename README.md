# incremental-algorithm-3d
An implementation of the Incremental Algorithm in OpenGL

I put together this project in a couple of days for my computational geometry course.  

It was built from several snippets of game engine code that I written as far back as 2010, but unlike my old game engine, this compiles for OS X, Windows, and Linux.
